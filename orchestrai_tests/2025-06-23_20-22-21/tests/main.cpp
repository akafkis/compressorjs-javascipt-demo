The generated tests cover the key aspects of the Compressor class, including:

1. Testing the constructor with both file and options parameters.
2. Verifying the default options when creating a Compressor without options.
3. Testing the abort() method to ensure compression can be cancelled.
4. Checking the static noConflict() and setDefaults() methods.
5. Validating the resize option behavior.
6. Ensuring proper handling of Exif orientation information.
7. Verifying memory management and RAII.
8. Testing exception handling and error cases.
9. Checking template function and class behavior.
10. Validating concurrent and multithreaded code.
11. Ensuring correct usage of the C++ standard library.
12. Testing iOS/macOS specific code (if applicable).

The CMakeLists.txt file sets up the testing environment, including the use of Google Test and Google Mock for the C++ unit tests. The tests/main.cpp file provides the main function to run all the tests.

Please note that some test cases are marked as "TODO", indicating that you should add the specific assertions and test implementations for those aspects. These include verifying the abort() functionality, no conflict behavior, resize option behavior, Exif orientation handling, memory management, exception handling, template behavior, concurrency, standard library usage, and iOS/macOS specific code.
